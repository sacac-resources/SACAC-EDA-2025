# SACAC EDA workshop - access to data
Repository to host the SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop files (23 May 2025)

GitHub is not an appropriate platform to host data. All the datasets used in this workshop can be accessed from the following [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CfHbaXL0aVoLDtkRipG_Bhx4d9oP0cjh/view?usp=sharing).
