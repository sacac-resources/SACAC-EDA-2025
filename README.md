# SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop
Repository to host the SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop files (25 March 2024)

## Cloning the repository to your Google Drive
The workshop will include multiple hands-on examples, and participants will have the opportunity to get to know the various EDA tools available. We will rely on the Python programming language, implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) which requires no setup and provides access to compute resources.

To take part in the workshop, you will need to clone this GitHub repository (repo) into your own personal Google Drive.

The `clone-repo` file will guide you through the process of cloning the repo to your own Google Drive. You can open the `clone-repo` file directly by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button below. Note that this will navigate you to the Google Colab site, so you may want to open in a new tab

## Checking your setup in Google Colab
After you have cloned the repo to your Google Drive, we suggest you run the `test-setup` notebook to make sure everything is running correctly. 
1. Go to your [Google Drive](drive.google.com) and navigate to the SACAC-EDA-2024 folder you've just cloned.
2. Go to `/examples` and open the `test_setup` notebook
3. Make sure to edit the path in the first cell of the notebook, as explained in the instructions.
4. You should be able to all cells in the notebook
