# SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop
Repository to host the SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop files (25 March 2024)

## Checking your setup in Google Colab
The workshop will include multiple hands-on examples, and participants will have the opportunity to get to know the various EDA tools available. We will rely on the Python programming languages, implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) which requires no setup and provides access to compute resources.

To take part in the workshop, you will need to clone this GitHub repository (repo) into your own personal Google Drive, which by implication means you will need a Google account.

The `clone-repo` file will guide you through the process of cloning the repo to your own Drive. After you have cloned the repo to your Drive, we suggest you run the `test-setup` notebook to make sure everything is running correctly.
