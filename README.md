# SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop
Repository to host the SACAC Exploratory Data Analysis workshop files (23 May 2025)

## Setup

### Cloning the repository to your Google Drive
The workshop will include multiple hands-on examples, and participants will have the opportunity to get to know the various EDA tools available. We will rely on the Python programming language, implemented in [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) which requires no setup and provides access to compute resources.

To take part in the workshop, you will need to clone this GitHub repository (repo) into your own personal Google Drive.

The `clone-repo` file will guide you through the process of cloning the repo to your own Google Drive. You can open the `clone-repo` file directly by clicking on the "Open in Colab" button below. Note that this will navigate you to the Google Colab site, so you may want to open in a new tab. You will need to provide permission for the repository to be cloned to your Google Drive. If you prefer, you may simply download the repository as a zip-file and upload it to your Google Drive manually.

### Checking your setup in Google Colab
After you have cloned the repo to your Google Drive, we suggest you run the `test-setup` notebook to make sure everything is running correctly. 
1. Go to your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and navigate to the SACAC-EDA-2025 folder you've just cloned.
2. Go to `/examples` and open the `test_setup` notebook
3. Make sure to edit the path in the first cell of the notebook, as explained in the instructions.
4. You should be able to run all cells in the notebook

### Data used during the EDA workshop
The data used during the workshop is not hosted on GitHub. Please see the `README.md` file in the `\data` folder of this repository for information on loading the necessary data.

## Topics covered during the workshop
### Nature of data / Pre-processing / Time series
